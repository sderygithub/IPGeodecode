Welcome to IP Geodecode!
======================================

IP Geodecode is a short coding challenge developed by Sebastien Dery, created to
ingest log containing IP data for which we want geolocalization data


Components
----------

IPGeodecode consists of:

     1) Python scripts.  These do not need to be compiled.
     2) Output logs. 	 
     3) Webserver. 		 Connect the decoding to a front end


Building
--------

This project is build around concepts of functionality. No state are kept in
memory and no compiling is required


Dependecies
------------

pip install geocoder
pip install pygeoip
pip install IPWhois
pip install geopy
pip install docopt
